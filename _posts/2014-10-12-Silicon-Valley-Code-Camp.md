I attended [Silicon Valley Code Camp](http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/) for the first time yesterday. SVCC is an impressive event, especially for a free conference. There are hundreds of sessions on a wide variety of topics. Yesterday I went to 4 sessions, and I am going back today for a few more.  

I plan on submitting a talk for next year's SVCC (likely about Go, but perhaps something related to distributed systems).
